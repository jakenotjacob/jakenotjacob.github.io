# Where is your towel?

I think I forgot where mine was today. Few things happened that will be
shakin' up the fort a bit, and I was/am far less prepared than I would
like to be.

Maybe a good start would be setting some goals for myself that I know are
rooted true in the dirt... true as steel.

Writing some puter programs sounds like a good plan. Let's lay some down.

---

  - FiveM Lua Object Resources
    - We're gonna shake some things up in the world of FiveM scripting by
    writing some resources in a nice little OOP fashion; instead of treating
    each resource as brand spankin' new off the bat, we're gonna model the
    foundations so folks can avoid it. Proper. Fuckin'. OOP. Lua. For fun.

  - Python-based Trello CLI
    - This is more just of something I want to do to keep my fingers fluid
    when it comes to writing some python. I want to also knock out using Trello
    regularly for managing my projects, so why not hit both at the same time?
    I hope to evolve this into a full blown TUI with some curses-based
    interface, but time will tell... for now, let's just getter rollin'.

  - Curses/Ncurses alternative
    - Ever since using ncurses for my Ruby-based IRC client... I wanted to
    throw the curses interface out the window. As much as I actually do love
    terminal interfaces, it was not a 'fun' experience, but a learning one.
    I'd like to write my own... already dippin' toes into the VT100 to see
    what basics I need to cover. This project should be a long burn, but I
    aim to write lots of posts on things I learn about it in the process.

I think 3 is a good start for now.

Maybe I'll end up adding a specific page for when I really start tickin' boxes
and knocking some off the list, but for now I'd rather not get too ahead of myself.


Break it down: small, realistic goals (though that last one, maybe a tad bigger).


I'll be checkin' in.
